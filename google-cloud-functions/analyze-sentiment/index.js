Analyze the sentiment of this restaurant review.
Assign a total score and scores for the food, the service, and the interior. The scores should be from 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 â€” the highest. If there's no sufficient data for some of the scores, return 0 (as a Number).
When assigning scores and overal sentiment take into account both the review text and the sentiments of the attached images and videos.
Return the response in JSON format [{}]. "sentiment" - "positive", "negative", or "neutral", "food" (0-5), "service" (0-5), "interior" (0-5).  The returned object should always be valid JSON.
Return the result 'Invalid review', formatted as a JSON object, for any reviews that aren't contextually related to the restaurant, contain inappropriate language, and/or are meaningless.
